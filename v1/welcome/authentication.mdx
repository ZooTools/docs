## üëã¬†How to use?

Once you obtain the API token from the ZooTools team, you just simply need to pass the bearer token in the request header to authenticate your requests.

This is an example using axios in JavaScript, but it would be similar for Flutter, iOS, etc.

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';

const API_TOKEN = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_TOKEN' // ask ZooTools team for a key
const ZOOTOOLS_API_V1_ENDPOINT = 'https://audience-consumer-api.zootools.co/v1'

const listId = '12345' // get it from your dashboard
const memberId = '23423423' // you will obtain this after creating a member.

// Example: Search if a user exists in my list.
axios
    .post(`${ZOOTOOLS_API_V1_ENDPOINT}/lists/${listId}/members/search`, {
			email: "jorge@zootools.co"
		}), {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}`,
      },
    })
```

## API Tokens -- Security Management tips

Hi fellow developer! Here is a list of good practises to make sure you don‚Äôt leak your API token. This list is not exclusive to common security good practises:

1. Store your API tokens secretively using tools like [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager), [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), similar.

2. Never hardcore or store your API token in a private or public git repo, this can compromise access to your account.

3. **Don't share or expose your API token on the frontend**.

<Warning>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS keep your API tokens on your backend. This is a common practise, but
  just wanted to stress this out just in case Exposing your API token in your
  mobile or web applications, means any user will be able to access your
  ZooTools account, both on read and write mode, and get access to your customer
  data.
</Warning>

4. On development mode, If you have multiple team members working with the ZooTools API, share your token always encrypted using a tool like [1Password](https://1password.com/).

5. Before going live in production, we can generate a new token that only your project admin will know and can store it secretly in whatever secrets vault you use (e.g: [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)). If your team is small or only you have worked on the feature, you probably don‚Äôt need this.

That‚Äôs all! Happy coding üëä
