## What can you do with the Audience API?

ZooTools Audience API contains all the actions to manage your contacts in your project, from adding a new contact, updating properties, deleting and more.

On top, ZooTools offers you security features like one time passwords, and email validation.

## ðŸ‘‹Â How to use?

Once you obtain the API token from the ZooTools team, you just simply need to pass the bearer token in the request header to authenticate your requests.

This is an example using axios in JavaScript, but it would be similar for Flutter, iOS, etc.

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';

const API_TOKEN = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_TOKEN' // ask ZooTools team for a key
const ZOOTOOLS_API_V1_ENDPOINT = 'https://audience-consumer-api.zootools.co/v1'

const listId = '12345' // get it from your dashboard
const memberId = '23423423' // you will obtain this after creating a member.

// Example: Search if a user exists in my list.
axios
    .post(`${ZOOTOOLS_API_V1_ENDPOINT}/lists/${listId}/members/search`, {
			email: "jorge@zootools.co"
		}), {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}`,
      },
    })
```
