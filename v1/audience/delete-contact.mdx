## Delete a contact by email

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import zootools from "zootools";

zootools.setApiToken("YOUR_ZOOTOOLS_API_KEY_FROM_THE_DASHBOARD");

const response = await zootools.contacts.delete({
  email: "jorge@zootools.co",
});

if (response.wasDeleted) {
  console.log("Contact was deleted!");
} else {
  // Errors, etc..
  console.log(response.reason);
}
```

```curl cURL
Coming soon
```

</CodeGroup>

## Delete a contact by id

If you store in your database the contactId from ZooTools, then you can pass it down to delete it.

If you don't store the contactId, use the previous example where you pass the email instead.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import zootools from "zootools";

zootools.setApiToken("YOUR_ZOOTOOLS_API_KEY_FROM_THE_DASHBOARD");

const response = await zootools.contacts.delete({
  // useful in case you store the contactId from zootools in your database
  id: "12312312",
});

if (response.wasDeleted) {
  console.log("Contact was deleted!");
} else {
  // Errors, etc..
  console.log(response.reason);
}
```

```curl cURL
Coming soon
```

</CodeGroup>
