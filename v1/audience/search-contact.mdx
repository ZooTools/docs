### [POST] Search contact

Use this endpoint to get a user object if you know their email,
wallet address or both.

We use a POST since email and crypto address are important information
to protect, so they will be encrypted and not available on any bad person
sniffing network requests.

HEADERS:

	headers: {
     Authorization: `Bearer API_TOKEN_YOU_GOT_FROM_US`,
  }
}

PAYLOAD
